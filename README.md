# shell_scripts

## clique_wp.sh
This shell script is for use with the wp-boilerplate repo that we use for new projects. This script assumes you already have the repository in your `Sites` folder.

It clones the latest repo, and copies and installs the files to your local environment.

## new_wp.sh
This shell script sets up a new WordPress isntall on your local machine with the parameters to choose your WP version, removes the default Post, Comment, and updates `Sample Page` to be labeled as the Home Page.


### Changelog
Version 1.0

* Initial commit of the shell scripts.
